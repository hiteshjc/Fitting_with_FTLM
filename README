This software was written by Anish Bhardwaj for performing SciPy fitting of Hamiltonian parameters 
for the dipole-octupole spin 1/2 model on a pyrochlore lattice. It calls a C++ code primarily written by Hitesh Changlani which does Finite Temperature Lanczos.

Additional scripts are available on request from Anish Bhardwaj (ab12k@my.fsu.edu).
